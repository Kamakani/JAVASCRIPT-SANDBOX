  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Create an array of objects called library. Add 3 objects with a property of title, author, status. Title and author should be strings (whatever value you want) and status should be another object wiuth the properties of own, reading, and read. Which should all be boolean values. For all status, set own to true and reading and read to false.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>
    You finished reading all of the books. Set the read value for all of them to true. Do not edit the initial object. Set the values using dot notation.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Destructure the title from the first book and rename the variable to firstbook.</p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>Turn the library object into a JSON string</p>
