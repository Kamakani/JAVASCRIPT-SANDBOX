// DATA TYPES

// String - Sequences of characters, Must be in quotes or backticks
// Number - Integers as well as floating-point numbers
// Boolean - Logical entity / true or false
// Null - Intentional absence of any object value
// Undefined - A Variable that has not yet been defiuned / assigned
// Symbol, - Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
// BigInt - Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle

// REFERENCE TYPES (Objects)

// Reference types or "objects are a non-primitive value and when assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that value.
// Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types

// STATIC TYPING VS DYNAMIC TYPING

// JavaScriupt is a dynamically-types language. This means, we do not explicitly define the types for our vartiables. Many other languages are statically-typed such as C, C++ and Java

// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which allows static -typing. This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors. TypeScript may be something you want to look into later on.
